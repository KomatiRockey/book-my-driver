# Updated project: uber-main (modified package.json)

What I changed
- Pinned core runtime packages to known recent versions for stability:
  - expo -> 54.0.21
  - react -> 19.2.0
  - react-dom -> 19.2.0
  - react-native -> 0.82.1
  - @react-navigation/native -> 7.1.19
  - expo-constants -> 18.0.10
  - @stripe/stripe-react-native -> 0.55.1
  - expo-font -> 13.3.2

- Set all other dependencies and devDependencies to the `latest` tag. This lets `npm` (or `yarn`) fetch the most recent release available when you install.

Local run checklist (Linux/Windows/macOS)
1. Make sure you have Node.js (>=18) and npm or Yarn installed.
2. Install Expo CLI globally (optional but helpful): `npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx expo`.
3. From the project root (where package.json is), run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you prefer yarn
   # yarn install
   ```
4. Start the Expo dev server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
5. If native build is required, follow Expo docs to create a dev build or use `expo run:android` / `expo run:ios` where supported. See Expo upgrade docs: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/

Notes and troubleshooting
- Some native modules (like `@stripe/stripe-react-native`) may require native configuration or specific Expo SDK compatibility. If you hit native build errors, consider creating an Expo dev build (`eas build --local` or `expo prebuild`) or follow the library docs to add native setup steps.
- If `npm install` pulls incompatible major versions, run `npm audit fix` and consult the library changelogs. I pinned the most load-bearing packages to minimize huge breaking changes.
- If you want I can run a dependency-by-dependency pinning pass (explicit versions rather than `latest`) — that requires more web lookups for each package.


Generated by ChatGPT — I updated `package.json` and bundled this into `uber-main-updated.zip`.
